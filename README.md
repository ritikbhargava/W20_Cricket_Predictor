# W20_Cricket_Predictor

Creating a cricket score predictor using XGBoost involves several steps. Here's an overview of the process:

1. Data Collection
Match Data: Collect historical data of cricket matches, including scores, overs, wickets, player statistics, match conditions, etc.
Feature Engineering: Extract useful features from the raw data. These might include the number of runs, wickets, overs, current run rate, player form, pitch conditions, weather, etc.
2. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Deal with missing values appropriately, either by filling them in or removing the affected rows/columns.
Categorical Encoding: Convert categorical variables (like player names, match venues) into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Normalization/Scaling: Scale numerical features to ensure that they are on a similar scale, which can help with model convergence and performance.
3. Feature Selection
Correlation Analysis: Use correlation matrices to identify and select the most relevant features.
Feature Importance: Utilize techniques like feature importance from tree-based models to select the most significant features.
4. Model Building
XGBoost Model: Set up and train an XGBoost model using the processed data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune the modelâ€™s hyperparameters (like learning rate, max depth, number of estimators) using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to improve performance.
Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
5. Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared, etc.
Validation: Validate the model on a separate test set to check for overfitting or underfitting.
6. Prediction
Use the trained model to predict scores for new cricket matches based on input features.
